            <p>
              For the past 30+ years, I dedicated my life to helping people live
              healthier, more vibrant lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Starting as a practicing chiropractor, I often found new ways to
              help more and more people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually I founded and co-founded 16 companies, many in health
              and wellness.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of these was Revealed Films, a media company that helped
              millions of people discover holistic solutions to the many
              challenges of modern life.
            </p>
            <p>
              When it came to healthy living, I thought I understood it all...
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">Until I traveled to the Holy Land...</p>
            <p>
              I was in Israel filming a documentary series about the life of
              Christ, and that's when everything changed.
            </p>
            <p>As I walked through the biblical landscape...</p>
            <p>
              ...sitting where Christ sat, standing where He stood, I came to a
              realization.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
              The physical manifestation of health IS a spiritual experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began to integrate my faith and health in a new way. I felt the
              living wisdom of The Bible in my being.
            </p>
            <p>
              That feeling, that vibration I felt in the Holy Land was
              life-changing. I began to wonder..
            </p>
            <p>
              ...might there be wisdom in the Bible to help us physically
              thrive?

                Purpose and determination filled my spirit. As I received more
                information found in scripture, I began noticing references to
                certain plants.
              </p>
              <p class="">So I followed the hints and signs...</p>
              <p>
                Eventually, a new vision began to form in my mind. One that
                combined my expertise in health and wellness with what I was

                  closer to God. It was known Biblically as a herb of
                  sanctification and used in prayer for blessings.

                  lips. Over and over, it shows up in association with water,

                  When the disciples found Christ’s tomb empty, one miraculous
                  herb covered the area outside. Ever since, this plant has had
                  a reputation for facilitating inner peace, emotional balance,
                  and a spirit of devotion.

                A natural antimicrobial so powerful it is effective against

                dormant Lyme disease. It is also one of nature's best pain
                relievers. It contains a remarkable cocktail of compounds that
                stimulate powerful opioid receptors AND reduce inflammation at
                the source of chronic pain at the same time.

                The most famous and well-researched plant in the world for liver

              <h3>Hyssop</h3>
              <p>
                This simple flower is rich in flavonoids and essential oils to
                boost health. It can work wonders for the respiratory and
                digestive systems, and is a traditional herbal remedy for colds
                and lung infections. In the stomach, evidence suggests it
                increases natural digestive enzymes, and deeper in the gut it
                helps fight parasites.

        <h2 class="text-center">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>What Does Wisdom Taste Like?</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p>
            Wisdom tastes absolutely delicious! Because we use such high-quality
            ingredients, Wisdom Formula tastes fantastic, even with no
            sweeteners or flavors added. You can add Wisdom Formula to salads,
            teas, drinks, and more for an extra health boost! It has a light
            botanical flavor that’s both full of natural goodness and free from
            anything artificial. The reason you’ll experience the flavor of
            botanicals is that we use such high-quality, fresh herbs that you
            can taste their delicious vitality the moment it hits your tongue.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Is shipping free?</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p>
            Free shipping is only valid in the US for 3 and 6 bottle orders. For
            orders of 1 bottle, shipping costs $5.95. There is a flat rate fee
            for each additional item for international orders. International
            shipping rates vary.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>What if it doesn’t work for me?</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p>
            We offer a 100% Good Faith guarantee. If for any reason Wisdom
            doesn’t work for you, we’ll provide a full refund for the first 180
            days. That being said, we are confident you’ll love how you feel
            taking Wisdom Formula.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>How long should I take Wisdom Formula to see results?</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p>
            Everyone’s body and health situation is different, so we cannot make
            any guarantees regarding how long it will take for you to see
            results. That said, Wisdom Formula’s benefits tend to come in waves.
            From the first drop/sip, many users feel the first effects and
            benefits appearing as early as a few hours after their first dose.
            Within the first few days, many users experience increased energy,
            clearer thinking, and improved sleep. Many users experience
            significant relief from their digestive, stress, and detoxification
            challenges and overall well-being 3–6 months in when taking Wisdom
            consistently.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Can I take Wisdom Formula if I’m pregnant?</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p>
            Wisdom is not recommended during pregnancy. Women and teenage girls
            both experienced health challenges with the continual use of herbs.
            Please consult with your doctor or health care professional before
            taking Wisdom.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Can I use Wisdom Formula with my other supplements?</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p>
            Yes, you can use Wisdom Formula with other supplements. The plants
            in Wisdom Formula are 100% safe and gentle and work with your body’s
            natural processes. If there are any concerns, please consult your
            doctor or health care professional before taking Wisdom.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Will I get subscription charges every month?</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p>
            No, Integrity is at the heart of our higher values and our
            relationship with our customers is very important. We will only
            charge your credit card monthly if you have a 1-time payment model
            subscription. Your credit card will never be charged automatically.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Are there any dietary restrictions I should follow?</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p>
            There are no dietary restrictions to avoid with Wisdom Formula,
            although you may find that reducing your consumption of gluten,
            dairy, and sugar will help improve your health and your results with
            Wisdom.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>
          Does Wisdom Formula contain Gluten, Dairy, Soy, Sugar, Corn or GMOs?
        </h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p>
            No, Wisdom does NOT contain any major allergens like gluten, dairy,
            corn, or nuts. It is also sugar-free, non-GMO, and vegan.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Is Wisdom fully organic?</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p>
            Yes, everything in Wisdom is fully organic, but we also go beyond
            that. When we source herbs, we look at the herb’s spiritual,
            energetic, and “biblical” significance. We not only verify all of
            our herbs are fully organic, we also test every single herb to make
            sure it is as potent as it can be to maximize your results. By going
            beyond just organic, we ensure that you are getting the most
            powerful herbs available in the world, and that you are getting what
            we say you are getting.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Can I buy Wisdom in stores?</h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p>
            No, this is the only place you can buy Wisdom Formula. In order to
            ensure the highest standard of quality AND keep prices low, we
            decided to not go with retail and make sure our customers are
            getting the best deal possible.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>
          How many bottles should I order? Do I really need more than one?
        </h3>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p>
            We highly recommend the 6-bottle package. This is the best value AND
            it helps you get the most from your investment in Wisdom. We offer
            the multi-bottle discounts for two reasons: 1. Because we believe in
            the product and want you to get the best possible results. 2. By
            offering this package, it ensures you’ll get the best results
            possible because you’ll have a full 6 months of Wisdom to really
            experience the benefits. When you purchase multiple bottles of
            Wisdom, you not only save the most money, but you are also covered
            by our Good Faith guarantee. This is why many of our customers have
            ordered Wisdom Formula in larger quantities, as experienced the
            highest level of satisfaction. Not only will you see the most
            benefits by using Wisdom, but you are also fully protected by the
            180-day no-questions-asked, money-back Good Faith guarantee.
